## Overview

This GitHub organisation hosts the open-source enablers developed for the **DRG4FOOD Toolbox**, a core output of the **Digital Responsibility Goals for Food (DRG4FOOD)** project. DRG4FOOD is a Horizon Europe–funded research and innovation initiative exploring how digital solutions can be designed and deployed more responsibly, with a specific focus on improving trust, transparency, and responsibility in a data-driven food system.

At the heart of the project are the **Digital Responsibility Goals (DRGs)** — a framework of guiding principles for developing digital solutions that prioritise human values alongside technical performance. The DRGs address multiple dimensions of digital responsibility, including digital literacy, cybersecurity, privacy and transparency, data fairness, human agency and identity, and trustworthy algorithms. Together, they provide a shared reference point for designing, assessing, and implementing digital solutions in complex, real-world contexts.

This organisation serves as a **developer-facing companion** to the DRG4FOOD Toolbox. It brings together practical building blocks, open-source enablers, and structured references to open-source repositories developed within the DRG4FOOD project, including contributions emerging from funded innovation projects, to support the development of trustworthy, human-centred digital food system solutions.

## Relationship to the DRG4FOOD Trust Stack and Toolbox

The **DRG4FOOD Trust Stack** refers to the integrated set of frameworks, platforms, resources, and open-source enablers developed within the DRG4FOOD project to support the creation of trustworthy, responsible, and human-centred digital food system solutions.

At the centre of the Trust Stack is the **DRG4FOOD Toolbox**, the primary developer-focused platform of the project. It presents the funded innovation projects demonstrating how the Digital Responsibility Goals (DRGs) are applied in practice across different digital food system use cases. It includes detailed project descriptions, demonstrations, and supporting materials that explain what was built, why, and how.

As part of the DRG4FOOD Toolbox, the **Digital Responsibility Database** offers a large, curated collection of externally referenced open-source software, tools, frameworks, standards, and guides. These resources are mapped to the DRGs to support discovery and informed reuse across a broader digital responsibility–oriented technology stack.

This GitHub organisation forms the **open-source code layer of the DRG4FOOD Trust Stack**, hosting software enablers developed through the DRG4FOOD project and its funded innovation projects. Most of the code published here originates from digital food system solutions developed and presented in the DRG4FOOD Toolbox and is made available as reusable technical building blocks for third-party developers.

Together, the Toolbox, Database, and this GitHub organisation form a coherent implementation ecosystem: the Toolbox explains *what was built, why, and how*; the Database supports *broad discovery across the wider ecosystem*; and this GitHub space provides *direct access to project-developed open-source enablers*.

## What This Organisation Contains

This GitHub organisation brings together a growing set of open-source repositories that form part of the DRG4FOOD Trust Stack. It hosts or references software enablers developed through the DRG4FOOD project and its funded innovation projects, as well as selected internal tools and reference repositories supporting the Toolbox.

The repositories collected here reflect different roles within the Trust Stack, ranging from project-derived implementation enablers to supporting and reference repositories that provide context, documentation, or integration support. Together, they form a curated codebase intended to support reuse, inspection, and adaptation by developers working on responsible, trustworthy digital food system solutions.

## How to Use These Repositories

The repositories in this organisation are intended as reference implementations and reusable building blocks for developers working on responsible digital food system solutions. They can be explored individually, adapted to specific use cases, or combined with other tools and frameworks referenced in the DRG4FOOD Toolbox.

Each repository provides its own documentation describing scope, assumptions, and intended use. Developers are encouraged to review these materials carefully and assess suitability for their own technical, regulatory, and organisational contexts.

## Governance, Licensing, and Attribution

Unless otherwise stated, repositories in this organisation are released under open-source licenses specified within each individual repository. Licensing terms, attribution requirements, and usage conditions may therefore vary and should be reviewed on a per-repository basis.

While these repositories form part of the DRG4FOOD Trust Stack, responsibility for integration, deployment, and compliance remains with implementing organisations and developers. Inclusion in this organisation does not imply certification, endorsement, or warranty of suitability for any specific use case.
